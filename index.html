  <section class="container"> <!-- texts of about me -->
    <p>Hey there! My name is Gillian, and I'm a
      Dartmouth 22' who will be majoring in Computer
      Science with a minor in Digital Arts. I spent
      the first fourteen years of my life in the
      beautiful city of Shanghai before going to Boston
      for high school. I've always wanted to build my own
      games since I was a child, so I've been working on
      independent game projects throughout high school. </p>

      <p>
        Here's a bit of info on the things that I know:
        <dl>
        <dt>Coding-wise:</dt>
        <dd>
        	•	I learned Java in high school, created a simple Super-Mario style platform game with it, and could independently write useful programs with it; I also had experience with command based programming in Java as the software person for my high school's robotics team
        	•	I work with Unity3d to create games, using C# to write the scripts of my games
        	•	I've used HTML, CSS and Javascript in a Node.js web app project that virtually simulates my high school's bookstore.
        	•	I worked with Google AppsScript to process data in Google Sheets and Matlab to build models of a mountain in Utah for skiing routes
        	•	I've written a Bash script for a photogrammetry software pipeline
        </dd>
        <dt>(Digital) Art:</dt>
        <dd>
        	•	I loved to doodle on paper since I was little; at 13 I purchased a drawing tablet and started doodling digitally
        	•	I love pixel art a lot, possibly tied to the fact that my childhood best friend was Nintendo Game Boy Advance
        	•	I worked with Maya and Blender to create 3d models for items sold in my high school's bookstore
        	•	I did a one year research on the topic of photogrammetry and have worked with softwares that could scan multiple 2d photos of an item to render a 3d model
        	•	My experience with Unity allowed me to have a basic understanding of terms such as sprites, textures, materials, lighting and shading, camera rendering, etc.
        </dd>

        <dt>Music:</dt>
        <dd>
        	•	I enjoy all kinds of music, especially jazz
        	•	I played the piano, guitar and harmonica
        	•	I love coming up with tunes and melodies, and would compose short digital songs with Garageband; my goal is to be able to completely be in charge of composing music for my games
        </dd>
        </dl>
